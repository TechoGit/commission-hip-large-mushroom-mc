About
This program is a port of CUDA Application made by Andrew (Gaider10 Github) from Minecraft@Home Discord called Commission which its goal is to search for the largest mushroom biome in Minecraft Small Biomes or Large Biomes (1.18+) to HIP (ROCm AMD)

Prerequisite

AMD GPU RDNA3+ (9000 Series, 7600+ Series)

Head to the releases (right hand side of your screen if desktop) and download base off you want large biomes or small biomes (Default) 

Once you've downloaded the correct release, open up cmd or whatever cli you prefer and head to the location where you downloaded it 

do ./nameofthefile.exe and it should start searching seeds from a random picked number downwards results will start appearing in the console as it goes along

all of them will be sent to output.txt in the directory so if close it by mistake then don't worry all your results are safe

How to build from source

i'll do a writeup in a bit in regards to this but its a bit awakard to build it from source cause 9000 Series support is still in alpha stage and hasn't been released so you have to use alpha dlls with ROCm to get it compile properly
